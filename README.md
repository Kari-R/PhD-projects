# PhD Projects

Five C++ implementations produced as a part of my doctoral research, each located in its own subdirectory.

The programs solve various structure learning problems. Structure learning refers to the act of finding a graph that encodes the underlying dependence structure of given data. For more information, you can read the preamble part of my doctoral thesis: [Optimization Algorithms for Learning Graphical Model Structures](https://helda.helsinki.fi/handle/10138/336484)

All code except for the Eigen library (`magsl-scorer/lib/Eigen/`) was written by me.
