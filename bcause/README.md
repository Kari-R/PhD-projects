# Bcause

This program learns optimal causal graphs based on given weighted (in)dependence constraints.


## Instructions

1. Please insert your CPLEX into the `solvers` directory. In particular, the following directories should be available:
   - `solvers/cplex/cplex/`
   - `solvers/cplex/concert/`
2. Run `make` in the directory to compile the program.
3. You can run the program with no arguments, i.e., `./bcause`, to see helpful information.
