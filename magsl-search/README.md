# Exact MAG Search

This program learns optimal maximal ancestral graphs with respect to given Gaussian BIC local scores.


## Instructions

1. Run `make` in the directory to compile the program.
2. You can run the program with no arguments, i.e., `./search`, to see useful information.

As an example, if the score file is `example.bic` then the search can be performed with `./search example.bic --check-lbs --simplify`
